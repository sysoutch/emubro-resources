  <p><strong>Updated:</strong> 2026-02-23</p>
  <h2>Before removing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm whether you want to remove only the DB entry or also delete files.</li>
    <li>For launcher games, removal usually only affects library records.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Safe cleanup flow</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Filter by platform/tag to verify selection.</li>
    <li>Remove in smaller batches when cleaning large duplicate sets.</li>
    <li>Rescan if you want to re-import corrected entries later.</li>
  </ul>
